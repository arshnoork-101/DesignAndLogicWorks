# Product SKU Processing System

This repository contains files for processing SKU-based product transactions for perishable and non-perishable items.

## Files

- `non-perishable.txt`: Describes the process for handling non-perishable items based on barcode scanning.
- `main.txt`: Contains the main logic to determine if an item is perishable or non-perishable and manage the checkout process.
- `perishable.txt`: Details the steps for processing perishable items, including price calculation based on weight or quantity.

Each file outlines the flow for handling items during scanning, adding more items, and completing the payment process starting from `main.txt`.
