# Paint Estimator App

This repository provides a paint estimation system that calculates the amount of paint required for a room, including the number of cans for both base and finishing coats, and generates a cost breakdown.

## Files

- **`areacalculation.txt`**: Calculates the total area to be painted by considering wall and ceiling dimensions, including objects (windows/doors) that shouldn't be painted.
- **`cancalculation.txt`**: Determines the number of cans required for both base and finishing coats, based on the calculated area.
- **`main.txt`**: Coordinates area and can calculations, then computes the total cost (including taxes) and displays a detailed receipt.

## Process Flow

1. **Area Calculation**:
   - Collect room and wall dimensions.
   - Subtract areas for objects like windows/doors.
   - Calculate the ceiling area as rectangles.

2. **Can Calculation**:
   - Based on the area, the required number of base and finishing cans are calculated. Users can input the number of coats, with the system suggesting a default.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Calculate total cost based on the number of cans, including taxes, and display a receipt with detailed breakdowns.

## Features

- **Area Estimation**: Calculates the area of walls and ceiling.
- **Paint Can Estimation**: Determines the number of cans required based on area coverage.
- **Cost Breakdown**: Provides a receipt with total costs, including taxes.

## Usage

1. Enter room dimensions and any objects on the walls that donâ€™t need painting.
2. Calculate the ceiling area by dividing it into rectangles.
3. The system estimates the number of paint cans required.
4. A detailed receipt is generated, showing the total cost and tax.
