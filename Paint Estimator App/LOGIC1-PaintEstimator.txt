1. START
2. Declare variables TotalArea, BaseAreaCoverage=11, FinishingAreaCoverage=16, BaseCans, FinishingCans, R1, R2.     
3. Display: Recommended number of base coats=2.   
4. Display: Do you wish to have a Base Coat?
	YES:
5.		Calculate TotalArea%BaseAreaCoverage and store it in R1.
6.		Is R1=0?
		YES:
7.			Calculate TotalArea/BaseAreaCoverage and store it in BaseCans.
		NO:
8.			Calculate (TotalArea-R1)/BaseAreaCoverage and store it in BaseCans.
9.			Add 1 to BaseCans.
10.		Do you wish to have 1 layer of base coat?
		YES:
11.			Display: Number of Base Cans required: BaseCans.
12.			Display: Recommended number of Finishing Layers: 2
